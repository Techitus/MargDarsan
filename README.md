# Frontend Develpment Roadmap

## What is Frontend Development?
Frontend development, also known as client-side development, is the process of creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It involves designing and implementing the visual elements and interactive features that users see and interact with directly in their web browsers. Frontend developers work on the "front end" of a web application, which is the part that users interact with, as opposed to the "backend," which deals with server-side logic, databases, and data processing.

## Why Frontend Development?
Frontend development is important because it shapes the way websites and web applications look and work for users. It focuses on creating appealing designs, ensuring ease of use, and making content accessible to everyone. Frontend developers also ensure that websites function well on various devices and browsers, making them versatile. They add interactive features and optimize performance to provide an engaging and efficient user experience. In essence, frontend development is crucial for creating user-friendly, visually appealing, and accessible digital interfaces.
